# Temperature and Humidity Montitor

A project used to measure temperature and humidity inside a room and display and log that information for future reference. 
The sensor data is sent to a local Node-RED dashboard using MQTT and Node-RED handles visualizing the data and logging the measurements in .csv files. 

## Software / hardware requirements

The monitor consists of an ESP32 microcontrolled hooked up to a SHT30 sensor.
